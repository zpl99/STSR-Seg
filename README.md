# STSR-Seg

The code of the Spatio-Temporal aware Super-Resolution SEGmentation framework (STSR-Seg). The STSR-Seg is utilized to produce the China Building Rooftop Area (CBRA) dataset. 

The page is still being organized, the paper related to the method is being reviewed by the journal "Earth System Science Data (ESSD)", and we will release all the source code in the near future.

### Requirements
Please install PyTorch=1.7 following the [official instructions](https://pytorch.org/), install ee following the [official instructions](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/python_install). For Chinese users, you can refer to Zhihu to install ee and solve the problems that may occur during the installation process. [Zhihu](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/29186942)
